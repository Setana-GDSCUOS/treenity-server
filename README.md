This is an application that provides an AR-based social networking/exercising experience.

## üìñ Explanation

 We propose a way to reduce your carbon footprint through fun-filled walking.
As users walk while using the app, the app records their steps.
The number of steps recorded is converted into points for buying seeds and buckets of water,
Users can plant seeds and water trees in places they frequently visit through AR technology and build up their efforts toward nature and health.
Not just this! Users can share their hard work with other users and also interact with the world directly from their Android smartphones!

By walking and watering, you will be filled with the power of steady exercise.

üë£Let's just plant your walks!üë£
